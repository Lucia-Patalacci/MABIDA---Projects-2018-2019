Exam Assignment

#### Exercise 1
We want to predict the trend of hourly users for a bike-sharing service through the definition of a statistical forecast model based on the observed variables contained in the data-set (training set) described below. The best model selected on the basis of the inferential analysis of the training set, will subsequently be adapted to the values ​​of the predictors contained in the test set for the calculation of the expected "CNT" values

#### Exercise 2
We want to predict whether a customer of a bank will be insolvent following a payment by credit card (DEFAULT = "yes") or not (DEFAULT = "no") by defining a statistical classification model based on the observed variables contained in the data set (training set) described below. The best model selected on the basis of the inferential analysis of the training set, will subsequently be adapted to the values ​​of the predictors contained in the test set for the calculation of the expected values ​​of the variable "DEFAULT" categorical response.
